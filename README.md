  ## Description
  This projects automates to process of writing a README file. I was motivated to create this project so that other developers and myself could spend more time on our projects rather than devoting that time to making a README. Automating the process of writing README allows more time to be spent on making improvements to the project and potentially add things that otherwise would not have been feasible due to time constraints. While creating this project I learned a lot about using node.js. I found there was a learning curve to using everything through the terminal and found the syntax of writing callback functions difficult at first but gained confidence during this process.
